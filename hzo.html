								<h2>Introduction</h2>
                                </header>
								<p>HzO (previously known as project Water Gunslinger) is a game project started in 2015, the last one made by Greedy Grid Games, my former startup which later became InVoid. Even though these startups doesn't exist anymore, the game is currently in a redesign phase, with no predicted release date. This redesign should affect most of the game main characteristics.</p>
								<p>Developed initially as a top down shooter with 2D art, HzO was a game developed to raise awareness about waste of water and how it can kill the human race, specially when you use water as ammo in a zombie invasion. The player must use one of numerous water guns available in the game to shoot and kill zombies that come in waves. You can use puddles, fonts and other sources of water to charge your guns, but they have limited resources, so you must be careful and manage your ammo.</p>

								<h2>Gameplay</h2>

                                <br>This video shows a little bit of an early alfa gameplay, which was used to demonstrate some of the game core features and concepts done, even though the art, the items and the level design was just temporary and not polished yet.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>HzO has later been trough two open gameplay tests, and in both of them the feedback was, in general, positive. Animated with the good reception of the game, we decided to add new mechanics to it, making it an online cooperative game with a long story mode, numerous stages, customizable items and skins and other new interesting features. Furthermore, the art style would change to 3D with an isometric view. The game design is still in work and the project is currently on hold, but wait for interesting news in the near future!<p>
