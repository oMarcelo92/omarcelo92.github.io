								<h2>Introduction</h2>
                                </header>
								<p>Undertake was a game project developed in 2014 (release date: winter 2015) by Greedy Grid Games, my former startup. It was made as a college project and abandoned after the end of semester, when we focused in the development of another of our games, HzO.</p>
								<p>Undertake was supposed to be a 2D platformer with RPG elements, released for Windows, Mac and Linux and featured on Steam. The story was about an angel who, in one of his habituals patrols on limbo, got his wings stolen by a lurking demon. The problem is that angel's wings are their energy source, and without them, he wouldn't even be allowed on heaven anymore.</p>
                                <p>So the game proceeds whilst the angel explores the underworld in search of the demon who stole his wings, learning new skills and finding out details about how demons and other creatures sees the angels, while starting to question himself and his own nature.</p>

								<h2>Trailer</h2>

                                <br>This trailer shows the first stage of the game, while the angel enters the underworld and starts to meet his firsts enemies, while also showing glances of the posterior stages and concept images showing the background story.</p>
                                <p>My part in the development of Undertake was pretty much every programming or engine related tasks, core gameplay (player movement, enemies AI, players and enemies stats, physics, etc), game HUD/UI/menus (design and implementation), all polishing and particle effects, event systems and more. I also did level design for the three stages presents in the game and was responsible for the implementation of every piece of art this game had, which was composed by CC0 art and some custom art made by Murilo, 2D artist of Greedy Grid Games.</p>
